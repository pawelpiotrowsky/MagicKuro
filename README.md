# Simple coding task - a file differentiator

1. Use GitHub and send us back a link to your repository.
2. Time 2 hours.
3. Just Java SE, no external libraries allowed (or necessary).
4. We wish to see object-oriented programming, so use this as an opportunity to showcase your skills.
5. Code a solution to handle "magic numbers" for images and text files. 

## Drawing - optional step

We accept drawings of your design, if you decide to draw anything before you start coding. Just photograph them and add them to GitHub repository, with a text file explaining what is on a drawing (if needed). This is **NOT** a required step.

## File differentiator

There are various people and not everyone is honest. Some would pretend a file is a JPG, while in fact, it's a dangerous, malicious binary. 
Write a program, that prevents that from happening!

1. You accept all extensions. No matter the extension, attempt at reading will be done.
2. You verify "magic numbers". 
3. Program must say if the extension is true (a txt file is a text file, an JPG is a JPG).
4. If extension isn't handled, program honestly states so (throwing an appropriate exception, one that fits this situation).
5. We expect JPGs, GIFs and TXT files to be handled. Anything more is a plus.
6. If extension lies, program states: Extension is A, while actually it's a B.

Anything that is NOT stated in the above list, is not necessary. Console-only program is absolutely fine, no GUI is necessary. 

## Magic numbers?!

If you never heard of magic numbers, don't worry. Here are good resources to study:

1. Unix `file` command, which tells you what a file is.
2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures
3. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format#Magic_number
4. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)#Magic_numbers_in_files

## How is time counted?

With Git. :-) So please, do git commit often. This also helps us witness how you broke the problem down.
Reading time and learning time doesn't count. Drawing time also doesn't, if you did a drawing. 

Coding time does. Please let us know when you will start coding (date and time) so we can actually watch your progress as it happens.

## Closing remarks

Looking at how number of people approach such tasks, we have some remarks:

1. Your performance will be taken into account along with other stages of the hiring process (including previous ones)
2. If others outdid you, that's that. We're usually looking for around 12 people, sometimes less, in total.
3. OO may be more tricky and/or important than you think.
